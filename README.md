## Control Flow
Order in which lines of code are excecuted in a program.

# Sequential control flow
Execution of code statements one after another, in the order they apear in the program.

# Conditional control flow / Control flow
Execution of code statements based on some input

if tomorrow is Saturday
   set alarm for 7
if tomorrow is Tuesday
    set alarm for 6

# Boolean Data Type Re-visit
Data type that has two values: True and False. Boolean values are used to control the flow of the program.

# Comparison Operators / Relational Operators
Decide the relationship between the operands. Result of comparison is boolean value (True/False)

if tomorrow == Saturday
   set alarm for 7
if tomorrow == Tuesday
    set alarm for 6

# if, elif, else
Simplest form of AI (you could say that)
'if' checks the condition, if true, the inteded blocks get executed, if false, it skips the intended blocks.

today = "Tuesday"

if today == "Monday":
    print("Set an alarm for 5 AM!")
elif today == "Tuesday":
    print("Set an alarm for 6AM!")
elif today == "Saturday":
    print("Set an alarm for 7AM!")

temperature = 40

if temperature > 35:
    print("It's hot outside.")
if temperature < 15:
    print("It's cold outside.")
else:
    print("The weather is mild.")

# pass
Does nothing, just...pases..for now.

# Boolean Operators
AND, OR, NOT. Operands needs to be boolean as well
